Welcome to The Recovery Ride.  My name is Don.  I'm not a strong rider.  I'm not particularly fast.  And I crash a whole bunch going down the singletrack.  But I like bikes.  I really, really like bikes.  So this is where I'll be posting my thoughts, ideas, musings, etc...on all things bike related.  Everything from wacky imposibilities for a monstercross bike to photos/stories of epic rides to new toys and tech.  

Before we get started, I'd like like to give a really huge shoutout to my good friend, [Malvika Sharan], for helping me set all of this up.  Thanks, Malvika!  Couldn't have done it without you.

So hop on the saddle!  Let's do some active recovery.
